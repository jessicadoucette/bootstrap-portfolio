<h1>Bootstrap Portfolio</h1>
<p>Assignment - to recreate the Basic Portfolio from Homework 1 using Bootstrap. The nav, layout, and images should all be responsive.</p>

<h2>Navigation & Footer</h2>
Naviagation was created using navbar, navbar-default, container-fluid, and  navbar-header classes. The logo was used using navbar-brand with text-light. The navigation links were used with nav-link. 
To change the hover color on the navigation links, I used the "text-secondary" Bootstrap class and overrode the styling to match the teal color. 

A sticky footer was made with a combination of Bootstrap's footer and container-fluid classes. 

<h2>Index Page</h2>

The content was created using the Bootstrap container class. 
Three rows were used. 1 for the header of the container, 1 for the image and copy, and 1 row containing a smaller column for the list of favorite things. 

<h2>Portfolio Page</h2>
Within the container, four rows were made: 1 for the header, and 3 rows for the images. 
With the image rows are 2 columns for each photo within the row. 
Images are responsive according to their row, using Bootstrap class img-fluid. 
The banners were made using css. 

<h2>Contact Page </h2>
Contact page has a Bootstrap element of form and a bootstrap class of form-group. Diving more into the form code, I used bootstrap classes for the names, emails, and message portions of the form. 

The sticky footer for this page was made using navbar fixed-bottom.
